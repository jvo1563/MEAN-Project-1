# MEAN-Project-1

### Objective:

Create a recreational-sports league-management application that enables a league
administrator to manage the coaches and players for any of the teams. Choose any
sport you like! But the admin must possess the ability to view, add, remove and
alter any of the teams, coaches, or players, including moving a coach/player from
one team to another. The application should make it easy for admins to do their
jobs, so clear and concise UI/UX is critical. The application should also take into
consideration of possible edge cases, like teams having a maximum capacity, what
happens if there are no coaches assigned to a team, what happens when teams are
deleted while they have players on them, etc.

### Functional Requirements:
  - Must be a full-stack solution consisting of:
    - Angular frontend (HTML, CSS, TS)
    - Express backend utilizing TypeORM
    - PostgreSQL Database
  - Code should be available in a public GitHub repository
  - Possesses all required CRUD functionality
  - Handles edge cases, errors and exceptions effectively, application-wide
    - Deleting a team what happens to the members
### Non-Functional Requirements:
  - Well-documented code
  - Code upholds industry best practices (Solid/Dry)
  - Industry-Grade UI (User Interface)
  - Intuitive UX (User Experience)
### Bonus Objectives (suggestions only):
  - Use both types of database for different aspects of your project
  - Achieve 90% code coverage for unit testing
  - Deploy your application to a cloud provider
  - Incorporate the scheduling of actual games into your application
  - Anything else you might find challenging/exciting to implement!
  - (Don’t forget to hit those functional/non-functional requirements first…)
  - Authentication with accounts
